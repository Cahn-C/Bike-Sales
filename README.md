# Bike Sales Project

In this project I will create a comprehensive sales dashboard for the executive team at the bicycle retail company that I've partnered with from my internship. First, I will pull out the relevant data from the companies database using SQL Server, then I will design a well-structured and dynamic dashboard using Excel and Tableau

<br>

### Project Overview
1. Enter into the company's relational database by creating SQL script to generate a detailed dataset that provides me with all of the information that I need to help start the process of creating a comprehensive and dynamic sales dashboard for the executive team <br>
2. Import the SQL generated dataset into Excel, and use Pivot Tables to generate a dynamic dashboard <br>
3. I will then connect the Excel datasheet that contains the SQL generated dataset to Tableau and use the information to generate a visually pleasing dashboard for management <br>
